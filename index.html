        <p>Hate speech detection refers to the process of identifying and filtering harmful or offensive content, typically found in online platforms like social media, forums, and blogs. It involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect text that promotes violence, discrimination, or hatred based on race, gender, religion, or other personal attributes. This task is often challenging due to the nuances of language, context, and cultural differences. Models are trained on large datasets of labeled examples, learning to classify text as either hateful or non-hateful. The goal is to automatically flag harmful content to maintain a safe and respectful online environment. With the increasing prevalence of online hate speech, this area of research continues to evolve, aiming for better accuracy and context-aware detection systems.</p>
